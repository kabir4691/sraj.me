The tools that power my daily life as a software engineer.

## hardware

* [Tom Bihn Synapse 25](https://www.tombihn.com/products/synapse-25?variant=19611983431) - A solid water resistant bag. The lack of an internal frame is an aquired taste, but really useful where you're in a cramped airplane seat. Fits all the items below and some more.
* [Desktop](https://in.pcpartpicker.com/list/fzhfNQ) - Mid-tier linux box that does a great job at dealing with development load than my laptop.
* [13-inch 2017 Macbook Pro](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/) - 🤷‍♂️ at least there's no touchbar.
* [Pixel 3](https://store.google.com/product/pixel_3) - Great camera, great size does the job for me.
* [9.7" iPad Pro with the Apple Pencil](https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/ipad/ipad-pro-9-7) - It's a bit old but runs the latest iOS and the battery still works. I primarily use it for note-taking.
* [Bose QC35](https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/over_ear_headphones/quietcomfort-35-wireless-ii.html#v=qc35_ii_black) - Best travel headphones by far. Dare I say it is quite comfortable.
* [RHA Trueconnect](https://www.rha-audio.com/in/products/headphones/true-connect) - For when headphones are not practical.
* [Victorinox Zip-Around wallet](https://www.amazon.com/Victorinox-Zip-Around-Wallet-Black-Logo/dp/B00UCAMO4S/) - Really useful if you travel around (quite a few countries in Europe are not card-friendly).
* [Logitech MX Master](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Cross-Computer-Control-Windows/dp/B071Z8RZHG) - I really dig the multi-device support and quick-switching.
* [Anker PowerCore Speed 20000 PD](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071WNWRNC/) - Amazingly portable charger from Anker supports Power Delivery, can even charge my laptop when I'm not actively using it.
* [Drop Ctrl Mechanical Keyboard](https://drop.com/buy/drop-ctrl-mechanical-keyboard) - Great switches. Programmable RGB per-key lighting. What else do you need?


## software

* [1Password](https://1password.com/) - Nifty password-manager, syncs with Dropbox.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - I spend most of my day here.
* [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) - Superfast app launcher and custom workflow executor.
* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) - SwiftUI.
* [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) - Lookup documention quickly.
* [Toggl](https://toggl.com/) - Gotta track that ⏰.
* [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) - Best task-manager bar none.
* [podcst.app](http://podcst.app) - Great podcast client for the web 😉.
* [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) - Superfast terminal for the macOS.

## shell

* [zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) - oh my zsh is life.
* [neovim](https://neovim.io/) - For when I need something faster than a web-browser.
* [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) - Fuzzy anything is a win my books.
* [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) - A better grep.
* [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) - JSON processor for your cli.
* [autojump](https://github.com/wting/autojump) - Fuzzy file system jumper.
* [now](https://github.com/zeit/now-cli) - Crazy simple serverless cli.
* [omz git plugin](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/plugins/git/git.plugin.zsh) - deserves an entry of its own, they're that good.
